# Object-Relational Mapping (ORM): E-Commerce Back End

## Task

Internet retail, also known as **e-commerce**, these days is very popular. The situation made for all, just to stick around where you are and get everything without having to worry about being infected.

This assignment is just a back end for an e-commerce site. Here I configured a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database and used postman to test the API.

## Getting Started with Model View Controler (MVC)

This project is only a back end for an e-commerce site.

## Available scripts
Clone the repository to your project folderto make yours, and do the following:

This will install the node modules to your project folder.

**npm init** / **npm i**

Now, just run the following command in your terminal:

**npm run seed**

Then, the following:

**nodemon ./server.js** / **npm run start**

## You have to make sure, if you have POSTMAN or INSOMNIA to test the API.

## Mock-Up

The following animation shows the application's GET routes to return all categories, all products, and all tags being tested in postman:

![In Post, the user tests “GET tags,” “GET Categories,” and “GET All Products.”](./Assets/gif/User-gets-all-the-category-lists-when-they-use-GET-tag.gif)

The following animation shows the application's GET routes to return a single category, a single product, and a single tag being tested in Postman:

![In Postman, the user tests “GET tag by id,” “GET Category by ID,” and “GET One Product.”](./Assets/gif/GET-tag-category-and-product-by-ID.gif)

The following animation shows the application's POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for categories being tested in Postman:

![In Postman, the user tests “DELETE Category by ID,” “CREATE Category,” and “UPDATE Category.”](./Assets/gif/Delete-And-Update-Category.gif)

My walkthrough video also shows the POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for products and tags being tested in Postman.
